OPENWRT-PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES:
  kmod-batman-adv  (this depends on kmod-lib-crc16) 
  wireless-tools

DEBIAN DEPENDENCIES:
  batman-adv seems to be installed on default. You need to install batctl, if that script is not available
  this script tries to setup everything using the sys/class interface

WHAT DO THIS PACKAGE?:
  - It installs on script with all needed defaults running in Mesh mode
  - Script set up everything needed to get the Box in Mesh mode 
  - Box in Mesh don't have to be a AP at same time

WHY AN EXTRA PACKAGE?:
  - I don't want to add the Mesh-software dependency to the normal PB-Package
  - Easier Update if something changes


NOTEBOOK?:
 - Not every notebook can hold two network-interfaces online
 - You can join the network download this <on Work> and do <on work>
 - currently there is no iptables included. You won't be able to route
 - Software needed: iw, ifconfig, bridge-utils like br-ctl  & iptables Including support for "Bridge-nf"  in some cases

FAQ:

I'm getting a "SIOCSIFFLAGS: No buffer space available" - what is this?
   - It seems you card cannot run with an exchanged MACAdress, switch it 
off.
   - Remember runnin <scriptname> stop to clean up the partly created stuff
